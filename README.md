## Encryption Application
The Encryption Application is a simple and intuitive tool designed to demonstrate and implement several popular encryption algorithms.
This application allows users to securely encode and decode messages using classic ciphers, making it an ideal resource for learning about basic cryptography.

## Supported Ciphers:

**Caesar Cipher:** A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of places down the alphabet.

**Polybius Cipher:** A cipher that uses a 5x5 grid of letters and encodes pairs of coordinates to represent letters in the plaintext.

**Vigen√®re Cipher:** A method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.

## Key Features: 

**User-Friendly Interface:** The application provides a straightforward interface for inputting plaintext and viewing the encrypted output.

**Encryption/Decryption:** Support for both encryption and decryption of messages with multiple cipher algorithms.

**Learning Tool:** Ideal for educational purposes to understand the workings of classical encryption techniques.
